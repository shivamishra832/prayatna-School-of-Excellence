We are a young team of working professionals, college students, sr. citizens who are committed for social welfare through "education reforms". Prayatna is working in urban rural areas to improving quality education especially in migrants and urban disadvantaged youth. Also focused at policy implementation in govt. schools and assist in admissions through the effective implementation of Right to Education Act 2009. Prayatna does have the desire to revolutionize the Quality of education at the primary level by the introduction of innovative ways of teaching and learning. The necessity is to develop not just an educated citizen, but to produce a learned individual who can distinguish between what is right and what is wrong.  Prayatna journey had started by setting up an in-formal education centre for the migrant children for the village Molahera, district Gurgaon in January 2009. After that one more in-formal education centre is incorporated in village Jharsa, Gurgaon in October 2012. The concept of urbanization has emerged in recent years and problems regard to migrant people are also escalating with the increase of population in big cities. Urban rural areas have been the target areas of Prayatna of tier1 or tier 2 cities of country for past six years
